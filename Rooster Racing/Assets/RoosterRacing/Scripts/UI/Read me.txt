UI scripts divided by:

Bases: All UI scripts derives from these two except if they are UI displayed while playing, like the HUD.
	The UI scripts that manages an specific menu derive from the script 'UI_Menu'
	and those who manage the behaviour of the UI in a whole scene derive from 'UI_Managers' 

Debug: Scripts only implemented for build debug, never on a finished version.
 
Menus: Scripts that manages individual menus, most inherit from 'UI_Menu' base class.

Scene managers: Scripts that manages the behaviour of the UI in a whole scene. All of these derive from 'UI_Managers'.
